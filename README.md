# MapLoans
Web application which shows student loan data by state.

# Backend
I wrote the backend in Java using the Spring Framework.
I used Spring Boot to provide convention over configuration, which allows for rapid prototyping.

There is an Application class, a RestController class, and other Java classes. The other Java classes are used to load data and represent data.

Note:
I am reasonably experienced in Java backend servers. I have not used Ruby on Rails but I am excited to learn it.

# Frontend
I wrote the frontend to use Backbone.js. Since the data is extremely simple, I didn't need to use a Collection. If I had to display a larger amount of data, I would definitely use a Collection.

Backbone.js sends HTTP requests to the server's RESTful API, which responds in JSON.
The JSON fills out the data for the model, which is sent to an Underscore.js template.
The template is used to display the data for the user.

Note:
Since this is a prototype, I targeted desktop browsers. The app should display well on all modern browsers.
If I were to target mobile browsers, I would change the size of the map to fit better on smaller screens. I would not crop the image to allow it to display better on desktop browsers. I accepted this tradeoff because I believe that most users would choose to access the company's website on a laptop or desktop computer. 

# Wrap up
I would like to be considered for the full-stack and back-end positions.
Thank you.
